            When a company says 100,000 litres is their daily demand, how much
            of it is owing to inefficiency and fixes they need? How much is due
            to lifestyle choices? How much is due to conservation fixes? The
            efficiency fixes are easy to identify, track and disseminate
            information on (eg. Aerators on taps, low pressure shower heads,
            recycling of gray water, smart meters, and in the case of energy
            pumps, motors, lighting, and such). Most solution providers that you
            reach out to will have their stories to tell and case studies to
            present, both on energy and water savings. These will largely be
            centred on a technical fix. Some widget that they have designed and
            installed.
          </p>
          <p className="prose leading-loose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            But the conservation stories or the life style choices (doing with
            less, cutting down waste through individual action, raising
            thermostats to reduce cooling loads, etc) will be difficult to
            track. And these are based on consumer education, motivation and
            action. They are the most difficult, and most potent - much more
            than the efficiency fixes. I guess what I am trying to say is that
            .. Let’s get the data on how water/ energy has been saved so far in
            typical city settings. Armed with the results of such pilot
            investigations, make a strong, realistic pitch for a demand
            management strategy that works in the Bengaluru context. This is not
            going to happen by getting supply side chaps in the government for
            whom big spending is all that will be interesting. And they won’t,
            or can’t, solve your problem at your apartment or industry. If you
            want self-reliance and resilience for your own long-term sake,
            ‘demand side management’ is the best thing since sliced bread.
          </p>
          <p className="prose leading-loose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            In short, one needs data and a thorough understanding of how savings
            is being achieved among consumers today. AltTech Consortium provides
            for this… and there are, frankly few across India or the world who
            know how to blend the dynamic on cost efficiency and sharp
            solutioning.
          </p>
          <p className="prose leading-loose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            Overall, I think, if anyone is trying to work to brings savings at
            community or city scale, the aim of any communication strategy
            should be to debunk the myth that a supply side solution is at all
            an alternative. It is not. Never can be into the new future before
            when we have exhausted our rivers’ ability to supply, and have
            brutalised our lakes and groundwater strengths.... We should call to
            question the supply behemoths and raise the profile of efficiency
            and conservation as an energy / water resource. This in a nutshell
            would be the foundation for a people&#39;s movement on the demand
            side.

            Those Supply-side Guys are the Bane of our System!

          <p className="prose leading-loose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            It has become expedient for supply institutions (or supply
            influencers) to set up within their organizational ambit, a demand
            side program. They do it because of imposition from the outside,
            say, by the World Bank or some other worthy entity. Some of the
            people I have known have played that role when with the Bank and
            with multilateral institutions like the USAID or ADB or ADEME. Then
            when they persuaded the Government at the Centre or in states in
            India, to set up the Bureau of Energy Efficiency to plan and
            implement all the right things on the demand side, much to their
            dismay and horror, they found the Government had positioned the BEE
            within the organizational structure of the Ministry of Power - the
            country’s head priest on supply with behemoths like NTPC, NHPC,
            PGCIK, SEBs under their wings. It was like asking the fox to guard
            the chicken coop. BEE became their poster boy who danced to their
            tune.

            Supply-side approach can never moderate Demand
          </p>
          <p className="prose leading-loose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            In my humble opinion it does not make to play both sides of the
            energy/water equation. The focus has to be on the demand side to
            address the problems of runaway demand and explore opportunities to
            moderate it.
          </p>
          <p className="prose leading-loose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            With few exceptions, a supply side orientation will never be able to
            moderate demand - it will only work at satiating it. And in the
            process, accentuate the problems of financing, environmental
            impacts, and supply side inefficiencies. On the other hand, a demand
            side orientation costs less, is environmentally sound, and works
            towards moderating demand through deployment of efficient
            technologies and practices and its impact gradually relieves the
            pressure off the supply behemoths.
          </p>
          <p className="prose leading-loose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            The issue before us is … where, in the demand continuum, must one
            focus on, and how. Should it be in the noisy, acrimonious and often
            self-serving domain of advocacy – adding to the shrill voices of
            activists and the media that track and report them to the chagrin of
            the supply behemoths—thus creating suspicion and divide between the
            supply protagonists and the demand apologists? Or should it be in
            the patient, quiet work of testing, and validating sound end-user
            technologies, practices and solutions including policies that drive
            their market acceptance.

            The Sydney of the Cruel Irony of Water Efficiency Achieved Well
          </p>
          <p className="prose leading-loose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            It was Lady Mayor Clover Moore... the CEO of City of Sydney in the
            early 2010s, who gave a free hand to the small team the city
            administration formed for creating a Sydney Decentralised Water
            Master Plan. It was built from scratch on a blank canvas where no
            water strategy ever needed to exist given Municipality&#39;s brief
            to exclude water services. And this was done in a local council
            administration which was male dominated002E The City of Sydney&#39;s
            credibility and water position got a big boost when a whopping A$ 8
            million grant came in from the Federal Government for building one
            of the largest urban storm- water harvesting schemes in Australia.
            The City had never won anything more than A$2 million from the Feds.
            Despite this, the City administration and the good Lady got snubbed
            by Sydney Water which refused to offer any cooperation.
          </p>
          <p className="prose leading-loose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            It was an interesting (and a historic) moment of lack of gender
            balance when the Lady Mayor was invited to attend the meeting with
            the Minister for Environment (also a lady) who personally came to
            hand over the cheque to the Lady Mayor in the presence of the
            Federal Member of Sydney (a lady).  That stormwater harvesting
            scheme allowed the City to build a local non potable system. She was
            part of the celebrated demand-side project that the Sydney City
            Council and the utility executed when the dynamic Ms Moore was the
            mayor. Sadly the utility dismantled it by 2015 when demand for water
            fell by 30% thanks to sharp strategies of the Lady Mayor. The cruel
            irony is that they dropped water price and encouraged greater use
            for fear of loss of revenue! This is the challenge with all Govts
            and with supply-side thinking. This is a story of a water supply
            network which has become the backbone on which other recycled water
            network could be expanded. The idea of decentralised Water that
            Sydney practised, even if for a short spell, is a story that every
            Indian city needs.
