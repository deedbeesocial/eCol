            Zen masters usually tell us, ‘Go back to the beginning when you’ve a
            problem that defies solution.’ So I often go back to Gandhi and his
            amazing writings. In 1933 he writes, “God forbid that India should
            ever take to industrialism after the manner of the west... If [our
            nation] took to similar economic exploitation, it would strip the
            world bare like locusts.” We were 35 crore people then. Nehru in his
            Tryst with Destiny speech in 1947 said, “We are not 380 million
            people (38 crore) but 760 million hands that will build the nation.”

          <p className="prose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            In 1919, exactly a hundred years ago, there came to India an
            anthropologist turned urban planner, Patrick Geddes. He wrote in
            1926 a monograph on how Industrial Cost should include the
            ecological cost of water and forest damage that a product causes. He
            was the city planner for Baroda, Benares, Tanjavur, and four more
            cities.

            In 1819, 200 years ago, Sir Richard Burton, the Archaeologist first
            found relics of what was called the Indus Valley. In the next 30
            years of intense discovery it was clear that a 2500-year-old
            civilisation had vanished in just 60 years thanks to loss of
            forests, soil erosion, floods and extreme drought. Is there any
            reason why this can’t happen now? Look at the mess that our cities
            are even if they occupy less than 3 per cent of India’s landmass.
            They ravage and destroy the balance 97 pc in their greed for water
            from rivers and coal and uranium for energy and they put out
            mountains of waste into our oceans.

            Our cities — the way we know them — will have to die in a hundred
            years. Specially in India. Why should you be surprised? The writing
            on the wall is loud and clear. What can you do to redeem a little of
            this? From 35 crore Indians in 1947, we moved to 65 cr by the time
            Deewar was made with its famous ‘dialogue’. We are double that in
            less than 45 years.  What can we do meanwhile over the next 2
            generations or the next 5 Parliamentary elections? Can we stop our

            Himalaya in Arunachal Pradesh with 2800 small hydel dams with
            tunnels that threaten the entire eco-system. We could argue that

            moment we forge a unison of objectives we will have some level of

            Let’s define the challenge.
          </p>
          <p className="prose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            Jal. Jan. Jameen. Jungle. Janwar. How do we work on all five at once
            and in tandem, and in our cities too?  I take the national capital
            as an example. You could consider the size of your city’s challenge.
            Delhi has 3 crore people. At about 100 litres a person, the city
            today ‘supplies’ 300 crore-plus litres a day. The catch is that 45
            per cent goes in unaccounted and non revenue water. In effect Delhi
            supplies 50 litres per home to her 3 crore people. It’s depressing
            to know where this 300 crore litres come from. And Govts exploit our
            ignorance with massive spends of public money on ‘augmentation of
            water’ which means brutal public expenditure on drawing water from
            rivers that are far away from Delhi. In Bangalore they have been
            proposing the drawing of water from two distant rivers, the
            Sharavathy and Yettinahole, both in the Western Ghats, about 280 km
            away from Bangalore, at a staggering cost of 18,000 crore or nearly
            3 billion dollars.
          </p>
          <p className="prose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            Do we need these long-distance sources of water. At one-tenth this
            kind of spending, and with some good and simple demand side
            management that ensure we use, reuse, and conserve, we will achieve
            self-sufficiency in our waters.

            Is There Something We Can Do?
          </p>
          <p className="prose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            What can you and I do in our hotels, hospitals, college campuses,
            homes and offices to cut daily use by 80 per cent and take only
            make-good water as fresh water with zero import of water into our
            apartments. 65 per cent of China’s cities have already adopted the
            NeWater design approaches and manage water the way our grandfathers
            did. Waste water in those times went into lakes and tanks, they
            aerated. There was afforestation that ensured a natural process of
            cleansing of waters. Today we can achieve this tertiary water
            treatment, and then sophisticated yet cost-effective processes of
            treatment that produce ‘health grade water’ that you can I can
            drink, cook with, and wash clothes and vessels, and do all we need
            to do at home. It could be used for chiller plants in central AC
            systems, or for agriculture, or for manufacturing water.

            Is this possible? A slow revolution is taking place just now. Just 9
            companies that the AltTech Consortium has worked with over last two
            years to offer retrofit solutions for existing buildings, are today
            saving about 36 crore liters or 360 million liters a year. It is not
            big. But these are demonstrations that are scalable and replicable.
            Is it possible for very large high- density apartment blocks in
            Noida and Gurgaon to become water-neutral with no import of water by
            tankers. The answer is a resounding yes. The Consortium has designed
            two such high-rise high density apartments into becoming ‘zero
            import’ water enclaves. There are things you and I need to do as
            water-users. Set up systems for rainwater harvest and storage and
            use: Water-efficient fixtures, waste-water treatment systems that
            recycle black and grey water and treat some part of it to health
            grade water that you can drink. Such ‘Growing Your Own Water’ will
            make for 90-95 per cent of reuse. The small portion of ‘make- good’
            water can be drawn as fresh water from the external utility or from
            shallow open wells that utilise the shallow aquifers and leave the
            deep aquifer waters as common property for Earth’s crust to use for
            her own protection. Groundwater recharge is part of the exercise.
            Recharge of borewells to ensure ‘dead’ or ‘weak’ ones are revived to
            life. Fill and charge the deep Aquifer to a point where we return to
            use of open wells with shallow aquifers.  Deep aquifer water should
            be declared common property and borewells have to be banned as they
            have done in all of Europe and francophone parts of the world.

            at business, and get them to install these aerators in their taps
            and faucets? We will help you with the aerators at costs that will
            be much less than retail prices.   You tell us of hotels and
            hospitals and malls and commercial buildings where you can influence
            the facility managers to fix aerators. Pune started a campaign in
            2015 with 5 crore litres saved in the first year. They have reached
            50 crore litres a year. And are targeting 100 crore litres for this

            Forty pc of water in any city is unaccounted. Another 10 per cent

            There are 7 metros that consume about 1500 crore litres a day. They
            transport this water hundreds of kilometers and use billions of
            units of energy. These 7 metros occupy no more than 6,000 sq km and
            host no more than 15 crore people. The grim news is that in the next
            15 years these numbers are doubling for every metro.
          </p>
          <p className="prose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            The monies and energy wasted over the last 50 years on these
            projects is astronomical and senseless. How do you stop this. Blog,
            tweet, do whatever it takes to stop long- distance water sourcing.
            Push for the four steps of RWH, WEFs, STPs and recharge of borewells
            with a full loop in every building. If we cut our dependence on Govt
            for water and energy, Govts will have to reinvent their relevance.
            When we don’t want water and energy from them they will start
            thinking of what they should be doing to stop augmenting water
            Supply from long distance sources and start focusing on water
            management on the demand-side. The arrogance and power of the
            bureaucrat has to be addressed. You take away his power if we say we
            don’t need water or power from them!  There are 60 more cities with
            population of one million that demand another 2500 crore litres
            every day. India has 7900 towns but many of them are still
            manageable and need a grassroots movement to manage water. They are
            not in any crisis mode yet. Can we help to keep them that way?
          </p>
          <p className="prose text-black text-justify font-semibold font-bah mt-5">
            The demand is massive
          </p>
          <p className="prose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            135 crore people in India today need 13500 crore litres every day.
            That’s only drinking water. 1 TMC is 2800 crore litres. That’s a lot
            of water. Delhi today needs 40 tmc with all the leaks and thefts and
            poor inefficient use by industry, hotels, and homes. Bangalore needs
            20 TMC a year, or about 1 TMC for every 18 days. If we managed water
            right, we can stretch value from each TMC [which is 28+ billion
            litres] to about 45-50 days. We can bring down demand from 20 to as
            little as 6 TMC in Bangalore. Same logic goes for Delhi or for any
            metro. Our agriculture and industry and intense-use sectors like
            power and cement and textiles devour 3x each of our domestic water
            demand. Our total requirement of urban and industry is today at
            10,000 crore litres, or 100 billion litres a day. Agriculture along
            accounts is about four times this demand. There are ways of
            addressing these too. It is not for want of solutions that we have
            this mess. We are not willing to act. Elected members will act only
            if there is demand from you and I. The story of our power demand is
            as grim. We claim about 100 billion units of electricity a day.
            Delhi needs 5 billion units. Bangalore needs 2.5 billion units. Data
            centres and electric vehicles alone is pushing our demand by 600 MW
            when the entire power generation capacity is no more than 270
            MW. But that’s another story. An entire Indus Valley that once
            occupied two-thirds of what India today is, disappeared in 60 years.
            It was 2/3rd of today’s India. We can gripe about Govts not doing.
            We can draw blank on how public challenges are overcome. We can
            shrug and look away.  But the lure is powerful – of seeing change
            that will make the city and the countryside liveable.
            Remember, savings in energy due to water conservation/management
            outstrips the energy saved with efficiency measures in all sectors
            put together.

          <p className="prose text-black text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            Recently I was with the minister for minor irrigation of Karnataka,
            a BJP worker who has risen up the political ranks. He rose to speak
            and departed from the rest of the speakers by addressing the small
            audience of tie-clad industry leaders in Kannada. He said, it’s odd
            that he has to feel a little ashamed of wearing his dhoti and of
            being a villager in a large city. Two-thirds of India lives in her
            villages. We create no opportunity for them in the hinterland and so
            they come here to cook, wash dishes and drive cars. They can’t go
            back home for they don’t want to be seen to be a failure. Many come
            because they want to drop their caste connections. Gandhi wrote
            memorably in the 1930s that India’s soul rests in her villages. If
            we can provide our villagers cultivation water and share a good part
            of the money that is spent on cities with them, it’ll help them gain
            dignity and livelihood right there in their villages. They will have
            no reason to migrate to the lure of city lights. That’s a large
            ambition. At AltTech we are trying to make models for such water
            management for cultivation in drought prone districts. We have set
            about reviving 2 rivers north of Bangalore. There are 36,000 rivers
            in India and nearly all of them are dying because of our collective
            apathy. We the people are to blame. Not Govts.  You can act. Get
            your apartment or home or hotel or hospital or office to go off grid
            with near zero dependence for water and energy. Join the effort.
            We’ll guide it for you.
