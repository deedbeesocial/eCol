            There is a clear need in our cities for understanding why we use
            fresh water only once when technology has transformed to turn used
            water into pure drinking water.

            When you flush down the poop every day consider this. To each of us
            there’s no more than 130 grams we put out daily. We use 6 to 12
            litres to flush down the stuff. What happens to the ‘dirty’ water
            after you are done with using it for washing your bodies, clothes,
            kitchenware, cars and floors? You need less than 20 percent for
            drinking and cooking. Why would you use good clean water just once
            and wrestle with sourcing water from tankers and from bore wells
            that are dying or drying up by the day? Until now as city dwellers
            we got away with governments getting us fresh water from pristine
            areas at long distances. Today, with river water supply to each of
            us at about half our daily need and the number of us doubling in the
            city in just the next ten years, we need disruptive thinking. The
            per head statistic in Bangalore of Kaveri water supply is about
            75-80 litres with a lot lost (50 crore litres a day at ₹ 100 for
            every thousand litres of leakages and theft that are subsidised —
            every day). Bangalore gets 132 Cr litres of river waters, Pune gets
            120 Cr litres, Mumbai about 260 Cr and Delhi gets a whopping 320 Cr
            litres. All of them planned for about 130 litres to a head in their
            cities but lose about 40 percent to leaks and thefts or what is
            called euphemistically ‘non-revenue’ water.
          </p>
          <p className="prose text-black leading-loose text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            We have relied for a century on the ‘modern technology’ of using
            piped supply for getting fresh water for consumption. This has been
            around from the Roman times and makes no sense at all into a future
            where we have no more long-distance water sources. Every city has
            stretched its limits on sources of water from rivers, or lakes last
            built and nurtured a century ago. Those urban planners of the past
            who rooted for supply side solutions are at a complete loss and find
            themselves professionally irrelevant.

            Solutions to make our buildings net zero on water with all fresh
            water, once used, being treated for drinking again, is where the new
            engineering challenge of the 2020s lies. Things are set to change.
            It was Singapore that first showed the way in 2008 when in October
            8, their national day, the Prime Minister went on national
            television drinking what they called NuWater which was fresh water
            treated from out of waste water. China in the last 5 years has moved
            about 60 cities quietly without fanfare into treating their waste
            water into high grade, potable drinking water. No more than two
            litres to a person is used for drinking, with another 5 litres per
            person for cooking at a generous estimate. So much fresh water for
            all the rest of the use that don&#39;t need high hygiene, high-cost
            water. As someone said graphically, this is like using your new BMW
            to take chickens from a farm to the marketplace. What this last
            decade has seen in Singapore and China is a reinventing of the very
            basic idea — you cannot use fresh water only once. A composite water
            treatment system takes the tertiary STP treated water to a fourth
            level with a Health Grade Water treatment system that offers high
            quality water that the apartment can use. Aversion to drinking this
            water whose source is your own apartment’s waste water is the major
            behavioural hurdle. Bottled water that we pay up to Rs 20 has as
            source groundwater in farm zones where the chemical contamination is
            high, yet because it is packaged well, we accept it has water that
            is ‘safe’ to drink. Water that is supplied from tankers again comes
            from borewells in areas of the city’s periphery suffer the same risk
            of contamination.
          </p>
          <p className="prose text-black leading-loose text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            The water treatment business has changed dramatically thanks to
            advancement in human genomics and its impact on environment
            engineering. Water treatment systems now understand the structure
            and function of microbes in biological treatment systems. These are
            sequentially managed systems that essentially modify the operating
            conditions in a way that they infuse more powerful bacteria to
            cleanse water of organic content. These are technologies that are
            low on energy use. Apartments and other buildings can have these
            compact decentralised Health Grade Water systems with no more than
            the space of a garage needed. The conventional engineer of the past
            argued for long -- and he was right -- that the scale of economy
            offers better costs if centralised. That has changed over the last
            five years, both in terms of thinking and in the delivery of such
            treatment options.
          </p>
          <p className="prose text-black  leading-loose text-justify font-bah mt-5">
            The organic portion in the waste water -- the under 1 per cent part
            of waste water -- contains more energy than you need to treat this
            used water, about 2 KW per cubic meter that can be captured from the
            organic matter once you get this to settle down. There are
            technologies that are already available to recover this energy, with
            digesters that produce a variety of gas you can use in your
            kitchens. If the quantities of waste water and the organic matter
            are large -- over 300,000 litres a day in a building, it becomes
            viable to convert sludge to energy. In smaller quantities this
            organic matter becomes good rich compost that can help vegetation
            and gardens. The cost of installing these waste water to health
            grade drinking water systems is recovered in under three years if
            you assume cost of fresh water purchased by tankers to be about Rs
            15 per kilo litre. About 20,000 units of power is saved every year
            at 300 kilolitres a day of water use. This major disruption in costs
            of such technology has been possible thanks to deep end research in
            human genomes. The commercialising of such products has already
            succeeded. Many companies in India have taken to such Health Grade
            Water treatment systems but have not brought themselves to drink it
            — they have used them for chiller plants for centrally air
            conditioned buildings: a challenge of behavioural acceptance and not
            of the water- grade itself.

            There are apartments in Bangalore who have swung into action. Some
            pioneering builders have shown the way ten years ago. It’s only a
            matter of a couple more years before more such solutions hit the
            marketplace with used water becoming drinking water with the loop
            closed right at the point of use. Produce-consume as Alvin Toffler
            said ‘prosume’ is now going to be the norm. The burdensome legacy of
            the past, of water from rivers at a long distance will reduce
            dramatically as our need for water from pristine sources falls by 90
            per cent.

          <p className="prose text-black text-justify leading-loose font-bah mt-5">
            If there’s a certainty in this scenario playing out over the next
            half decade it is because it doesn’t need the government to step.
            The compelling logic of price and the proven quality of water will
            alone be enough to make our cities sustainable water if all
            stakeholders and users simply helped in educating the end water user
            to see good sense in this financially viable approach that will
            sustain the future of our cities.
